GasChangeTrap â€” Drosera Trap SERGEANT

GasChangeTrap is a Drosera trap designed to monitor Ethereum gas price anomalies (EIP-1559 baseFee) across consecutive blocks. The trap uses the standard collect() / shouldRespond() interface and triggers a response whenever the base fee changes by 5% or more. Alerts are handled by a separate contract, LogGasAlertReceiver, which logs anomalies for monitoring purposes. Ethereum users, DAOs, and DeFi protocols rely on predictable gas fees for operations. Sudden changes in baseFee can indicate network congestion, frontrunning risks, or abnormal activity affecting transaction costs. GasChangeTrap solves this problem by collecting the current base fee, comparing it to the previous value, and signaling an anomaly if the deviation exceeds the predefined threshold. The main trap contract, GasPriceAnomalyTrap.sol, implements the ITrap interface with two functions: collect(), which encodes the current baseFee, and shouldRespond(), which evaluates the percentage change between consecutive blocks and returns true if the threshold is exceeded. The response contract, LogGasAlertReceiver.sol, defines an event GasAlert and a function logGasAnomaly(uint256 currentBaseFee, string message) to emit alerts when anomalies are detected. This trap allows automated monitoring of gas price fluctuations, provides logging for analysis, and can be integrated into wider automation or alerting systems. GasChangeTrap is useful for developers, DAOs, and protocol operators who need to monitor network conditions, detect abnormal gas spikes, and respond quickly to potential issues. Deployment involves compiling and deploying both contracts to an Ethereum network, then connecting the trap to the response contract within Drosera configuration. Once applied, the trap monitors blocks in real-time, logging any significant changes in base fee for operators. Future improvements could include dynamic threshold adjustments, monitoring other network metrics, or chaining multiple traps for comprehensive network surveillance.
